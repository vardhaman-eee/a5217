# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  This subject deals with the economic operation of power systems. It emphasizes on load flow studies, single area and two area load frequency control and reactive power control.

## <a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

A5217.1 Apply the basic knowledge for economic operation, load frequency control and reactive power compensation.

A5217.2 Analyze the static and dynamic performance of single and multi area Load Frequency Control.

A5217.3 Analyzethe techniques and devices used for reactive power compensation.

A5217.4 Evaluate the load scheduling among various thermal and hydrothermal plants.

A5217.5 Model various components of an isolated power system.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24 hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
